I'm a software engineer in Oakland and I love building tools that solve interesting problems. I primarily work with [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) and [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) as a team lead at [Ziploop](https://www.ziploop.com). As you might have guessed, I'm excited to be a member of the JavaScript community -- especially in Oakland, where you can throw a rock at random and it will probably hit a major Node/NPM contributor. (But don't throw rocks at them! I'm grateful so many of them contribute to tech projects that make Oakland a better city for everyone.)

I graduated from Yale in 2010, served for two years with [Teach For America](http://www.teachforamerica.org/) as a high school chemistry teacher in the rural Mississippi Delta, and spent a year working as a lobbyist in Mississippi. My wife [Carmen](http://www.linkedin.com/in/carmenmarielee) still works for Teach For America, so education policy and technology are popular topics around our house.

Do you have an open-source project dealing with open data, government transparency, or education? Get in touch! I'd love to help.
