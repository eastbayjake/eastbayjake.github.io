I'm a software engineer in Oakland. I primarily work with [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) and [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/). I'm excited about working with smart people on interesting problems, especially problems that combine technical challenges with soft-skills -- working with non-technical counterparts, dealing with clients, or interacting with users and customers.
