I'm a software engineer in Oakland. I primarily work with [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) and [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) as a senior software engineer at [Ziploop](https://www.ziploop.com). I'm excited about working with smart people on interesting problems, especially problems that combine technical challenges with soft-skills -- working with non-technical counterparts, dealing with clients, or interacting with users and customers.

I graduated from Yale in 2010 and joined [Teach For America](http://www.teachforamerica.org/) as a high school chemistry teacher in the rural Mississippi Delta. My wife [Carmen](http://www.linkedin.com/in/carmenmarielee) still works for Teach For America, so education policy and technology are popular topics around our house.

Do you have an open-source project dealing with open data, government transparency, or education? Get in touch! I'd love to help.
